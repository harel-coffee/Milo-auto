# McGill Neurotech Club : Wheelchair Project (NTX 2019)

## 1. Who are we?

We're a multidisciplinary group of students with a shared passion for neurotechnology.

## 2. What do we do?

We build things with Neurotech! Mostly with the OpenBCI Cyton headset.

## 3. What is our project

This year we're building a mind-controlled wheelchair.
Unlike previous research into mind-controlled wheelchairs, we are using motor imagery and not P300.
Our setup includes:
- training data collection
- live collection signal processing
- a visualization GUI 
- a server to store the data
- sklearn ML to recognize motor movement

### What are each of the branches?
(to be completed)
- **backend-dev**: backend deveopement
- **frontend-dev**: frontend development
- **master**: final project goes here
